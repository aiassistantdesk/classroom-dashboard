1. Click **"Authentication"** in the left sidebar
2. Click **"Get started"** button (if first time)

### Step 2: Create Firestore Database

**Link:** https://console.firebase.google.com/project/classroom-dashboard-3a8c9/firestore

1. Click **"Firestore Database"** in the left sidebar
2. Click **"Create database"** button
3. Choose **"Start in production mode"** (we'll add rules next)

   - **For India:** `asia-south1 (Mumbai)`
   - **For US:** `us-central1`
   - **For Europe:** `europe-west1`
5. Click **"Enable"**
6. Wait for database to be created (30-60 seconds)

**Why?** This creates the database to store your student data.

### Step 3: Deploy Security Rules

**After Step 2 completes:**

1. In **Firestore Database**, click the **"Rules"** tab (top of page)
2. Delete all existing rules
3. Copy and paste these rules:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {

    // Helper function to check if user is authenticated
    function isAuthenticated() {
      return request.auth != null;
    }

    // Helper function to check if user owns the document
    function isOwner(userId) {
      return request.auth.uid == userId;
    }

    // Teachers collection - users can only read/write their own profile
    match /teachers/{teacherId} {
      allow read, write: if isAuthenticated() && isOwner(teacherId);
    }

    // Students collection - users can only access students they created
    match /students/{studentId} {
      // Allow reading if the student belongs to the authenticated teacher
      allow read: if isAuthenticated() &&
                     resource.data.teacherId == request.auth.uid;

      // Allow creating only if the teacher ID matches the authenticated user
      allow create: if isAuthenticated() &&
                       request.resource.data.teacherId == request.auth.uid;

      // Allow updating and deleting only if the student belongs to the authenticated teacher
      allow update, delete: if isAuthenticated() &&
                               resource.data.teacherId == request.auth.uid;
    }
  }
}
```

4. Click **"Publish"** button (top right)
5. Confirm by clicking **"Publish"** again

**Why?** These rules protect your data - only you can see your students, others cannot access your data.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

- Make sure you published the Firestore security rules (Step 3)
- Sign out and sign in again

### Can't sign in
- Verify Google Authentication is enabled (Step 1)
- Check browser console for error messages

### "Failed to get document"

## üìä Monitor Usage

**Dashboard:** https://console.firebase.google.com/project/classroom-dashboard-3a8c9/usage

Monitor your usage to ensure you stay within free tier limits:
- Authentication: Unlimited
- Firestore Reads: 50,000/day
- Firestore Writes: 20,000/day
- Storage: 1 GB

For personal use with ~100 students, you'll use less than 1% of these limits!
